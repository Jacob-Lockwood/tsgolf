# TSGolf

I'm making this site as a resource for learning how to get good at using
TypeScript's type system as a programming language of its own, with a focus on
teaching optimizations to make your code as short as possible (
[code golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf)).

This site will teach you enough to become an advanced user of TypeScript's type
system through examples with detailed explanations, tips ranging from
fundamentals to advanced tips, and a guided tour including challenges to test
your ability.

Please note that this site is currently _under construction_! Not all features
have been implemented, and most of the lessons have not been written yet. If you
would like to contribute content to the site, please see CONTRIBUTING.md.
